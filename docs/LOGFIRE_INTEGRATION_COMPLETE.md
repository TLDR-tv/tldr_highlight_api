# Logfire Observability Integration - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The TL;DR Highlight API now has comprehensive observability through Pydantic Logfire integration. This implementation provides distributed tracing, metrics collection, structured logging, and monitoring dashboards across all critical paths of the application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Infrastructure Configuration
- **File**: `src/infrastructure/config.py`
- Added comprehensive Logfire settings with environment variable support
- Configurable features: tracing, metrics, logging, integrations

    - `should_create_highlight`
    - `create_highlight`
    - `start` / `stop`
  - Added business event logging
  - Tracked agent performance metrics

#### Phase 3: Use Case Layer ✅
- **File**: `src/application/use_cases/stream_processing.py`
- Added `@traced_use_case` decorator
- Instrumented all use case methods

- Tracked business outcomes

#### Phase 4: Monitoring Dashboards ✅
- Created comprehensive dashboard configurations
- 5 pre-built dashboards:
  1. API Overview
  2. Stream Processing Monitor
  3. Business Metrics
  4. Infrastructure Health
  5. Error Tracking
- 6 alert configurations for critical metrics
- Export script for easy deployment

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### Distributed Tracing
- End-to-end request tracing from API to async tasks
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Parent-child span relationships
- Context propagation across service boundaries

#### Custom Metrics
- Business metrics:
  - Streams started/completed by platform
  - Highlights detected by method
  - API usage by organization
  - Processing duration and costs
- Technical metrics:
  - Request rates and latencies
  - Task execution times
  - Queue sizes
  - Error rates

#### Structured Logging
- Consistent log format with trace context
- Business event logging
- Error tracking with stack traces
- Performance logging for slow operations

#### Integration Points
- FastAPI automatic instrumentation
- SQLAlchemy query tracking
- Redis command monitoring
- Celery task instrumentation
- S3 operation tracking

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Stream with Full Observability
```python
# When a stream starts, the following happens automatically:
# 1. API endpoint traced with @traced_api_endpoint
# 2. Use case traced with @traced_use_case
# 3. Service methods traced with @traced_service_method
# 4. Async tasks traced with @traced_background_task
# 5. Business metrics recorded (streams started, quota checked)
# 6. Events logged (stream.started, agent.initialized)
```

### Viewing Traces in Logfire
```python
# All operations are automatically traced
# Example trace hierarchy:
# └── POST /api/v1/streams (200)
#     ├── start_stream (use_case)
#     │   ├── validate_user
#     │   ├── check_quota
#     │   ├── start_stream_processing (service)
#     │   │   ├── detect_platform
#     │   │   ├── save_stream
#     │   │   ├── get_agent_config
#     │   │   └── trigger_async_processing
#     │   └── trigger_webhook
#     └── ingest_stream_with_ffmpeg (async)
#         ├── probe_stream
#         ├── create_segments
#         └── extract_keyframes
```

### Custom Business Metrics
```python
# Metrics are automatically collected:
metrics.increment_stream_started(platform="twitch", organization_id="123")
metrics.record_highlight_confidence(0.95, "b2b_agent", "youtube")
metrics.record_task_duration(45.2, "detect_highlights_with_ai", "123")
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Core settings
LOGFIRE_ENABLED=true
LOGFIRE_PROJECT_NAME=tldr-highlight-api
LOGFIRE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
LOGFIRE_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Test stream processing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/streams \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://twitch.tv/test", "title": "Test Stream"}'

# View traces in console or Logfire UI
```
